# Coding Bat
This is holds my progress of working through python exercises in [Codingbat]( https://codingbat.com/prob/p124676)

### Creating the Virtual Environment
The first thing that I do is initialize my python enviroment by creating a virtual enviroment.

To do so I complete the following codes into the terminal:

1.  py -m venv venv
2. source ./venv/Scripts/activate

This creates the virtual environment for us.

### Linting 

Right after you install the virtual environment, you can install a third party linting package by typing the following code into the terminal.

1. pip install pylint pytest pytest-watch pytest-tesmon pytest-describe
    * if you get an error message telling you to upgrade pip then just go ahead and upgrade it by typing  **py -m pip install --upgrade pip** 
2. pip freeze > requirements.txt
3. git add requirements.txt
4. git status
5. git commit -m "venv setup"
6. git push

Each of the following code their own folder
